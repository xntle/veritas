## Problem Statement

From PFAS “forever chemicals” contaminating the water of over **158 million Americans**, to **199 million tons of plastic** choking our oceans, hazardous materials are flowing through our ecosystems unchecked. 

Industrial runoff, outdated waste systems, and toxic pollutants are entering human food chains — sparking a crisis that’s both **environmental** and **deeply human**.

The EPA is stepping up enforcement — but how do we ensure companies take responsibility **by design**, not just when forced?  
How do we build a future where **waste is verifiably tracked**, not hidden?

---

## The Problem

- **158M+ Americans** exposed to PFAS-contaminated water  
- **199M tons of plastic** in our oceans  
- **35M tons of hazardous waste** generated in the U.S. every year  
- Industrial toxins are leaking into food chains due to poor tracking  
- Public is uninformed. Companies hide problems. Systems are reactive, not preventive.

---

## Our Vision

A world where hazardous waste is:
- **Transparently tracked**  
- **Publicly verifiable**  
- **Responsibly managed by design**

---

## The Solution

**A blockchain-powered hazardous waste tracking system**, offering:

- **Public ledger** for verified waste handling  
- **Smart contracts** for automated compliance  
- **Real-time alerts** for contamination risks  
- **ESG dashboards** for public trust & investor transparency

---

## How It Works

1. Waste data is **logged on-chain** at every step — generation, transport, disposal  
2. A **public dashboard** displays verified, non-sensitive metrics  
3. **Smart contracts** trigger alerts and reports for violations  
4. **All stakeholders** — regulators, companies, citizens — share a single source of truth  

---

## What’s Wrong with Current Solutions?

1. **Paper-Based & Siloed Systems**  
   Slow, hard to verify, and easy to falsify.  
   > “Cradle-to-grave” tracking sounds good — until someone loses the cradle or the grave.

2. **Easily Manipulated Records**  
   Forged data allows "off-the-books" dumping and poor accountability.

3. **Delayed Oversight**  
   Months-late audits mean damage is already done — too little, too late.

4. **Gaps in Chain of Custody**  
   Waste changes hands often, and tracking breaks down between stakeholders.

5. **Limited Public Transparency**  
   Communities near industrial sites have **no access** to real-time data.

6. **Reactive, Not Preventive**  
   No alerts, anomaly detection, or immutable logs — until it's too late.

---

## Benefits for Companies

1. **Lower Legal & Cleanup Risk**  
   Avoid fines, lawsuits, and billion-dollar settlements (e.g. 3M’s $10.3B PFAS case).  
   > EPA violations can cost **up to $78,000/day**.

2. **Streamlined Operations**  
   Cut paperwork, automate reporting, reduce overhead.

3. **ESG & Investor Appeal**  
   Attract green capital and meet sustainability goals.

4. **Stronger Compliance**  
   Stay ahead of tightening EPA regulations.

5. **Better Brand Trust**  
   Prove responsible waste handling to customers and communities.

6. **Insurance & Financing Edge**  
   Lower risk = better insurance terms & investor confidence.

7. **Long-Term ROI**  
   Fewer incidents, stronger reputation, sustainable savings.

---

##  Benefits for the Public

1. **Safer Water & Air**  
   Prevents illegal dumping near homes and waterways.

2. **Faster Response to Spills**  
   Real-time data enables proactive intervention.

3. **Cleaner Neighborhoods**  
   Reduces visible and invisible industrial waste pollution.

4. **Transparent Accountability**  
   Public can verify where hazardous waste is going — no secrets.

5. **Healthier Communities**  
   Less exposure to cancer-causing and endocrine-disrupting chemicals.

6. **Empowered Residents**  
   Access to environmental data builds trust and action.

## 📈 Market Opportunity

- **$16B+ global cost of water pollution** annually  
- **30+ U.S. states pursuing PFAS litigation**  
- **Rising demand** for ESG-compliant environmental technologies  
- A massive gap in the U.S. industrial waste tracking infrastructure — ready to be filled

---

Let’s stop hiding waste. Let’s start tracking it — transparently, publicly, and responsibly.

>  A cleaner future begins with traceable accountability.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
